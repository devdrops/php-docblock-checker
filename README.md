A basic CLI (Command Line Interface) tool to verify if your PHP classes have DocBlocks.

###What it does?

This tool can:

 - Check if every PHP class and it's methods does have their own DocBlock.

###What it does not?
 - It doesn't check for the integrity of your DocBlocks **at this time**.

###What does it requires?
Please check [`composer.json`](composer.json) for details.

###Where is the documentation?
Please check [`docs.md`](docs.md) for further information on how to use this tool.
